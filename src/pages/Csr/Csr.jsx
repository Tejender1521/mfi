Our initiatives fall under the following general categories: education, healthcare, women empowerment, snatiation, child care, skill development, environment & community development and education. We as a socially conscious federation wish to help the most vulnerable and marginalized members of the societyâ€”such as special needs children, girl children from rural/ tribal areas, uneducated children, members of socially disadvantaged groups, unemployed women and other deprived communities. The numerous CSR initiatives taken by MFI have impacted some lives of children, girls and old age people. The scholarships, financial help and donation of equipment / much needed facilities helped many people to uplift themselves. We urge you to join us and utilize CSR funds for better social causes." />
